# AngularReactive

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.6.

## Running the application (from code)

You need to install Node.js on your computer. After that, you can execute:

- `npm install`: To download and install the dependencies.
- `npm start`: To start the application. You can navigate with your browser to `http://localhost:4200`.
Alternatively, you can also run directly `ng serve` if you downloaded Angular CLI.

Make sure you start first the Spring Boot backend app and the MongoDB instance, 
otherwise this one won't work properly.

## More details, functionality and Docker

See [parent README file](../README.md).
